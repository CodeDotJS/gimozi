__Overview__

I often use random emojis in description whenever I'm creating any repositories and sometimes end up spending more than necessary time finding the suitable one which can fit the hypothetical aesthetics of the project, so I decided to build something which can be easily accessible and suits my needs, so I built [Gimozi](https://gimozi.vercel.app).

__*You can copy*__

- Markdown code (e.g., :+1: `:+1:`)
- Image URL of the emoji
- Unicode value (e.g., U+1f44d)
- Base64 image data *and*
- Directly download the emoji as image.
